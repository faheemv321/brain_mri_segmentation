Malignant brain tumors, whether primary or metastatic, present formidable clinical challenges due to their aggressive nature and limited treatment options. 
This work tries to address the pressing need for novel therapeutics through the development of AI-based models for the automatic segmentation of brain tumors, 
leveraging the precision and soft tissue contrast offered by MRI. In conventional quantitative imaging analyses, manual segmentation by radiologists introduces 
time-consuming processes and inter-observer variability.

This implement a simple AI model for brain tumor segmentation. The integration of sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically segment brain 
tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) not only promises to expedite the analytical processes within biomedical research but also we can speed up research 
work and get a deeper understanding of how the brain works. This could help us learn more about brain diseases and how treatments work in early research phases.
